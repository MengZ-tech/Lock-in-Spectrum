# Lock-in-spectrum
Lock-in Spectrum: A Tool for Representing Long-term Evolution of Bearing Fault in the Time-Frequency Domain using Vibration Signal 

Here is the implementation code for the Lock-in spectrum. This tool uses the frequency sweeping principle of a lock-in amplifier (LIA) to measure signal amplitude components over a range of frequencies. When applied to long-term monitoring data of bearing vibration signals, it allows us to observe how fault components evolve in the time-frequency domain, even in scenarios where common time-frequency tools like STFT struggle.

The core code of this tool is available in the GitHub repository, and an implementation case on the XJTU-SY dataset is provided in the following link:
